## 🕹️ How It Works
* **Fuel Your Journey:** Every correct answer in Anki earns you **Realm Coins**. 
* **Strategic Movement:** Use your coins to traverse a hexagonal map. Different terrains affect your vision and movement cost.

* **Global Competition:** You are matched against medical students, law scholars, and everyday learners in a race of consistency and retention.

## 🗺️ Biomes & Hazards
The world is not always friendly. Your study habits determine how you survive:

* <span style="color:#74b9ff; font-weight:bold;">❄️ Tundra:</span> Can cause you to **Freeze**. You must perform "Speedy Reviews" (under 5s) to thaw out.
* <span style="color:#e74c3c; font-weight:bold;">🌋 Volcanic:</span> Intense heat can **Burn** you. Only a high volume of reviews can extinguish the flames.
* <span style="color:#f1c40f; font-weight:bold;">🏜️ Dunes:</span> Sandstorms cause **Blindness**, wiping your known map. You must study to regain your bearings.
* <span style="color:#95a5a6; font-weight:bold;">⛰️ Mountains:</span> Impassable by normal means. Spend a study session to **Climb** them for massive vision bonuses.
* <span style="color:#8e44ad; font-weight:bold;">🏛️ Ancient Ruins:</span> Stop and study at ruins to decipher signals that reveal the locations of Keys or the Artifact.
